# beautiful_soup_scraper
This is a program that utilizes the Beautiful Soup HTML parser to parse JavaScript and scrape the rental status
of appartment listings on Street Easy. There are also tests written into the program to test the accuracy of the scraping.
The tests use downloaded static HTML representations of Street Easy listings.
