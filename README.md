# beautfiul_soup_scraper
This is a program that utizlizes the beautiful soup HTML parser and selenium to parse JavaScript to scrape the rental status
of appartment listings on Street Easy. There are also tests written into the program to test the accuracy of the scraping.
These tests may need to be updated periodically as the status of the apartments used for testing change.
